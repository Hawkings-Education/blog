	<h2>Humanistic technology</h2>

	<p><strong>Technology is a form of politics. If you don't create it, someone else will create it against you.</strong></p>

	<p>Society is angry with technology, especially with its impact on children and teenagers, and rightfully so.</p>

	<p>In 2010, seeing a child with a mobile phone was normal; we called them 'digital natives.' As parents and educators, we thought we didn't need to do anything. Many believed they didn't like technology. History has never favored the illiterate, nor the digitally illiterate.</p>

	<p><strong>The first war with AI has already happened: social media. And we lost.</strong> These apps seek to maximize your screen time. Imagine if their goal was to maximize physical connections between real people. It would be a different story.</p>

	<p>Let's not repeat the mistake of social media with AI. Educators and parents must actively use and understand it.</p>

	<h2>Our commitment</h2>

	<ul>
		<li>We won't accept investors who don't share this vision, knowing this won't maximize profit, but it will maximize impact.</li>
		<li>We won't lose control of 51% of the company between the founding partners.</li>
		<li>Our main goal will remain the number of students we help significantly each month.</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>What we ask of our clients and users</h2>

	<p><strong>Be active.</strong> Understand the technology. Use it. If you don't, you'll end up being a slave to someone else's technology.</p>

	<p><strong>Make AI your ally.</strong> Ask it for what you need.</p>

	<p><strong>Know the ingredients of what you consume.</strong> A chicken nugget is not the same as organic chicken, nor does it cost the same. A free AI tool is a chicken nugget. Demand to know what model you're using.</p>

	<h2>On the future of teachers' jobs</h2>

	<p>The change coming is significant. We don't want to downplay it. We want to help you. We are not the problem, just as Word doesn't cause anxiety problems in teenagers. Denying Hawkings is like being sick and not going to the doctor.</p>

	<p><strong>The good news: Intelligence is becoming a commodity; human values and consciousness are what matter.</strong> And in the end, that's the most important thing, though as a society, we've forgotten it. We'll help you focus on accompanying the student.</p>

	<h2>On the use of technology in classrooms</h2>

	<p>We don't believe in an education glued to a screen. We believe that a paper book is better than a PDF book. It's not technology for technology's sake.</p>

	<p>If you use a screen, it should be because you have access, for a period of time, to incredible content or an intelligence that helps you. The rest of the time, share it with others and enjoy nature. It's part of your DNA, just like learning and growing in the best way possible.</p>
